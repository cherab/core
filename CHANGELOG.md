Project Changelog
=================

Release 1.5.0 (TBD)
-------------------

New:
* Support Raysect 0.8
* Add custom line shape support to BeamCXLine model. (#394)
* Add PeriodicTransformXD and VectorPeriodicTransformXD functions to support the data simulated with periodic boundary conditions. (#387)
* Add CylindricalTransform and VectorCylindricalTransform to transform functions from cylindrical to Cartesian coordinates. (#387)
* Add numerical integration of Bremsstrahlung spectrum over a spectral bin. (#395)
* Replace the coarse numerical constant in the Bremsstrahlung model with an exact expression. (#409)
* Add the kind attribute to RayTransferPipelineXD that determines whether the ray transfer matrix is multiplied by sensitivity ('power') or not ('radiance'). (#412)
* Improved parsing of metadata from the ADAS ADF15 'bnd' files for H-like ions. Raises a runtime error if the metadata cannot be parsed. (#424)
* **Beam dispersion calculation has changed from sigma(z) = sigma + z * tan(alpha) to sigma(z) = sqrt(sigma^2 + (z * tan(alpha))^2) for consistancy with the Gaussian beam model. Attention!!! The results of BES and CX spectroscopy are affected by this change. (#414)**
* Improved beam direction calculation to allow for natural broadening of the BES line shape due to beam divergence. (#414)
* Add kwargs to invert_regularised_nnls to pass them to scipy.optimize.nnls. (#438)

Bug fixes:
* Fix deprecated transforms being cached in LaserMaterial after laser.transform update (#420)
* Fix IRVB calculate sensitivity method.
* Fix missing donor_metastable attribute in the core BeamCXPEC class (#411).
* **Fix the receiver ion density being passed to the BeamCXPEC instead of the total ion density in the BeamCXLine. Also fix incorrect BeamCXPEC dosctrings. Attention!!! The results of CX spectroscopy are affected by this change. (#441)**

Release 1.2.0 (24 Nov 2019)
---------------------------

API changes:
* AxisymmetricVoxel vertices initialisation switched to Nx2 numpy array.
* Raysect VolumeTransforms used to handle shifts in coordinate systems rather than material specific offsets.
* Numerous minor changes (see commit history).

* Added Clamp functions.
* Added ThermalCXRate.
* Added optimised ray transfer grid calculation tools.
* Added opencl optimised SART inversion to tools.
* Numerous improvements to bolometry tool chain (see commit history).

Bug fixes:

* Numerous samller issues addressed throughout the framework (see commit history).


Release 1.1.0 (6 Mar 2019)
--------------------------

* Added voxel handling utilities to cherab.tools
* Added differentials to interpolator functions.

Release 1.0.1 (1 Oct 2018)
--------------------------

Bug fixes:
* Cherab package would fail if Raysect structures were altered due to using prebuilt c files. Cython is now always used to rebuild against the installed version of raysect. Cython is therefore now a dependency.


Release 1.0.0 (28 Sept 2018)
