Welcome
=======

Welcome to the Cherab project. A python library for forward modelling
diagnostics based on spectroscopic plasma emission.

Please note that these documentation pages are under heavy development
and might not become stable until we have finished migrating the source
code to github.

Contributions from the fusion community are welcome. Further details will be
posted soon on our recommended way of contributing. In the mean time,
interested collaborators should make contact with Dr Carine Giroud
(Project Leader) and Dr Matthew Carr (Core Developer) at
`CCFE, Oxfordshire, UK <http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/index.aspx>`_.

The following authors have contributed to the project:

Current Development Team
------------------------

* Matthew Carr (Core Developer)
* Alex Meakins (Architect/Core Developer)
* Alfonso Baciero (Model development)
* Carine Giroud (JET Project Management)


Contributors
------------

* Corentin Bertrand (Code)
* Andrea Callarelli (Code)
* Jack Lovell (Code)
* Nick Hawkes (Physics)
* Ephrem Delabie (Physics)
* Andy Meigs (Physics)


Project History
---------------

Prior to the public release, large scale development was performed by the
JET project team. Due to the inclusion of private intellectual property it
was not possible to release the full development history of the code prior
to the github release. For more information on the development of the code
prior to this point, please contact the JET project.
