Function Framework
==================


One of Cherab's most powerful features is the way it is designed to support mathematical
functions. Most of the physics interfaces in Cherab are specified in terms of math functions
of a specified dimension. I.e. density is a 3D function f(x, y, z), while :math:`\psi_n(r,z)`
is a 2D function in the r-z plane. The section of the documentation describes the various
utilities that are provided for slicing, dicing and projecting these functions.
